- Run Cypress - `npx cypress Open`

### Other Commands

- Run tests in terminal while storybook is being launched - `npm run test:ci`

## Comment Linting

- `change` - used when making a change to an existing file in the project
- `deprecate` - used when deprecating code
- `doc` - used when updating something related to documentation
- `fix` - used when fixing an error, warning or something else
- `finish` - used when finishing a feature or fix
- `refactor` - used when refactoring something such as a component or build tool
- `release` - used when preparing a new release
- `revert` - used when revert to a past commit
- `test` - used when making changes relating to testing
