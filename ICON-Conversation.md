# Icons with Co-Pilot

**Notes:**

- I started a new chat window
- I am using `Ask` mode with the `GPT-4.1` model
- I dragged the `components` folder into the chat so it had all the code immediately available.

## Initial prompt

Can you do a deep dive into my component library specifically looking at the implementation of icons. Some components that use icons, as examples, are Alert, Button, Cards, and more.

What I would like to do is leverage pre-existing svg icons in the assets folder in my components without introducing any additional external packages.

Review and let me know if you have any questions. Once we are clear we will build a plan of required changes and we will document that in a readme file for reference.

## First response

Current Icon Usage

1. Alert
   Uses Heroicons React components (CheckCircleIcon, ExclamationCircleIcon, etc.) from @heroicons/react.
   See Alert.

2. Button
   Accepts an icon prop, typically a React component (often Heroicons).
   See Button.

3. Card
   Has subcomponents for icons:
   CardIconThumb: Loads SVG from CDN using <img>.
   CardIconThumb.New: Dynamically fetches SVG from asset path and injects as HTML.
   Uses icon names from IconData.

4. Listing
   ListingIconThumb and ListingIconThumb.New fetch SVGs similarly to Card.

5. Icon Component
   Icon expects a React SVG component, not a raw SVG file.

6. SocialIcons
   Uses inline SVG markup for each social service in SocialServices.

Pre-existing SVG Assets

- SVG icons are stored in:
  - public/assets/font-awesome/
  - lexical-icons
- Icon lists are exported in JS files (icon-list.js, icon-list.js).

Questions/Clarifications

1. Do you want to replace all Heroicons usage with your own SVG assets?
2. Should the icon prop for components accept a string (icon name) and load the SVG from assets, or do you want to keep support for React components?
3. Should icons be injected as <img> or inline SVG (for styling flexibility)?
4. Are there accessibility requirements (e.g., alt text, titles) for these icons?
5. Should we standardize the asset path (CDN vs. local assets)?

## My replies, with follow ups questions

1. Yes, the goal is to replace heroicons as a dependency and replace it with individual SVG files from font awesome that we have in assets/icons

2. What are the pros and cons of each option? What I want in the end is the ability to use an Icon component with props for the icon name, size and colour with the ability to expand more over time if necessary.

3. I believe all these icons can be rendered as SVG code instead of images. But I am unclear of how sizes and colours will work with this implementation, can you explain that?

4. No these are decorative and do not require alt text or titles.

5. I can look at this after. it'd like to add checks for local vs github pages to load from CDN. But for now, let's not worry about this.

## Second co-pilot response

2. Icon Prop: String Name vs. React Component

   2a. String Name (e.g., "check", "alert")

   Pros:
   - Simple API: <Icon name="check" size={24} color="red" />
   - Centralizes icon management (easy to swap SVGs, update paths, etc.)
   - Easier to enforce consistency (all icons come from assets)

   Cons:
   - Requires a mapping from name to SVG file (could be a lookup table or dynamic import)
   - Slightly less flexible if you ever want to pass custom SVG/React components

   2b. React Component

   Pros:
   - Maximum flexibility (can pass any SVG/React node)
   - Useful for one-off custom icons

   Cons:
   - Less control over icon source (could lead to inconsistent icon usage)
   - More complex API for consumers

   Recommendation:
   - Use a string name for the icon prop. This matches your goal of centralizing icons and makes future expansion easier.

3. SVG Rendering: Inline SVG vs. <img>

   3a. Inline SVG

   Pros:
   - Full control over styling via CSS or props (size, color, etc.)
   - Can easily change fill, stroke, etc. via props or CSS
   - No network requests after initial bundle (if imported)

   Cons:
   - Slightly more complex to implement (need to load SVG content as JSX or string)

   3b. Img Tag

   Pros:
   - Simple to use
   - No need to parse SVG

   Cons:
   - Harder to style (color, size) unless SVG is designed for it
   - Less flexible for dynamic styling

   Recommendation:
   - Render icons as inline SVG. This gives you full control over size and color via props and CSS.

How Size and Color Work:

- Size: Set via width/height props on the SVG element.
- Color: Set via fill or stroke props. You can pass a color prop to your Icon component and apply it to the SVGâ€™s fill attribute.

Next Steps

Plan:

- Create a central Icon component that:
  - Accepts name, size, and color props.
  - Loads the SVG from assets/icons (either via import or fetch).
  - Renders the SVG inline, applying size and color.
- Refactor components (Alert, Button, Card, etc.) to use the new Icon component.
- Remove Heroicons dependency.

Let me know if you want to see a sample implementation for the Icon component, or if you want to discuss the SVG loading strategy (import vs. fetch vs. require).

## My replies, with follow ups questions

I would like to finalize the plan and document it before we look at sample implementations.

For the icon prop (#2 above), the string name approach might be better for this project. I don't see anything more than font awesome SVGs and our own internally created SVGs from being used here. The con about the look up table, would this not be solved by using the file generated by the generateIconList.mjs file that lives in the root of the project?

For this purpose we will go with the string name approach.

For the rendering (#3 above) we will go with inline SVGs.

Answer my question about the generateIconList.mjs then use the supplied ICONS-Plan.md file to create an detailed plan of the changes required, how we will implement them, what can be removed, and how we will test the changes.

**Notes:**

- I dragged the `ICON-Plan.md` file into the chat so it was available for modification.
- At this point I am asking it to build a file so I will switch to `Agent` mode.

## Third co-pilot response

Yes, you are correct: the lookup table con for the string name approach can be solved by using the output from generateIconList.mjs. This script generates a list or mapping of available SVG icon names to their file paths in your assets directory. By importing or requiring this generated file in your Icon component, you can easily map a string name to the correct SVG file, making the API simple and maintainable.

**Notes:**

- Co-Pilot did not add the plan to the file, but it generated it in chat. I often have this issue when I am in `Ask` mode to figure things out. When this happens I feed it the file again and simple say `Add the plan to the file I have provided`.
